# Source Folders

- `extern`
    Contains all built-in libraries:
    - `al` - OpenAL 1.16 (or 1.17, needs confirmation) Changes: Uses custom SDL2 backend; AL built-in library works on Windows and MacOS. However, Linux is not supported thus it is important when building under Linux, native AL library are used instead.
    - `bullet` 2.83 - No changes.
    - `freetype2` - No changes.
	- `lua` 5.3 - No changes.
 
- `src`
    Contains engine code:
    - `core` - Low-level code:
         - `avl` - AVL tree container for internal usage (entity and items storage).

         - `system` - Contains basic debug print, error functions, check if file exists function and take screenshot function.
    - `notes`:
         - \* - For file I/O operations. It is important to use `SDL_rwops`. This is part of SDL, works everywhere and is suggested to maintain continuity.

         - `script_skeletal_model` - Animation control system.
         - `script_world` - Spawning objects, level transitions, level configuration functions, objects and effects generation.

    - `state_control` - Contains skeletal models state control handlers.
         - `state_control` - Main interface to state control module (binding special functions to the models).
         - `state_control_Lara` - Only Lara's state control control module.
         - `state_control_*` - All other objects control functions.
    - `audio` - AL audio sources, soundtrack manipulation and a storage module.
         - `stb_vorbis.c` - Ogg vorbis format loader.
         - `audio` - Main audio routine handler and public interface.
         - `audio_fx` - Sound effects helper.
         - `audio_stream` - Audio stream handler and public interface.
		 
    - `fmv` - transformed ffmpeg library part for FMV video format support.

    - `physics` - Contains abstract engine interface for working with physics. It is important to use it only within the engine code! Here ray/sphere test functions, multi-mesh models for skeletal models.
         - `physics.h` - Public module interface.
         - `hair.h` - Public hair type interface.
         - `ragdoll.h` - Public ragdoll type interface.
         - `physics_bullet` - Private implementation, based on bullet library. Stores all engine physics geometry, creates own physics geometry from level resources.

    - `gui` - Contains GUI management code (exclude console)
         - `gui` - Renders all debug strings, bars, load screen.
         - `gui_inventory` - Renders the inventory menu.

    - `character_controller` - Manages controls for the character under different state conditions i.e whilst (on floor, free fall, underwater, on water or climbing etc.). Also, helper functions and weapon state control functions are included.
    - `controls` - Parses input from SDL and updates engine input control state structure.
    - `engine` - Contains main loop function, SDL event handlers, and debug output functions.
    - `entity` - Main in-game object type structure and manipulation functions. Contains frame update functions, callback callers, physics state updater/checker functions.

    - `gameflow` - Contains the base module for interfacing with external LUA "gameflow" scripts. This module is responsible for tracking secrets and transitioning between different game states (i.e play FMV, play level etc) or setting special game/level specific parameters.
    - `image` - Layer module for reading pcx, png and saving png images. bpp = 24 or 32 only (RGB or RGBA only).

    - `main_SDL` - Only main function and engine start.
    - `mesh` - Base item for rendering, contains vertices and VBO.
    - `resource` - Simple layer for converting level data from VT format to a format this engine supports. There is also a floor data to collision geometry converter included.
    - `room` - Contains room structure and object ownership manipulation (entity is within in room c and moved to room d).
    - `skeletal_model` - Contains base model, animation representation structures for in-game usage. A unique skeletal model structure is implemented with a smooth skeletal model update algorithm. Multi-animation system algorithm, multi-targeting bone mutators algorithm (head tracking, weapons targeting).
    - `trigger` - Here is the main (in-game) sector trigger handler/parser and object functions caller.
