1. The main plan
----------------
First we need to implement TR1 gameplay, so TR1/2/3 functions tasks have higher priority over TR4/TR5 functions. The first objective is to make a simple, but stable and working version, then extend functionality to it step by step.

2. Build configuration
----------------------
* Todo:
	* Update internal image lib
	* Reduce number of dependecies
	* Make good autobuild system
	  

3. Code in main
---------------
* Todo:
	* `game.cpp`: many different logics in one place, needs to be refactored
	* make some modules (not all!) interface more abstract (hide internal realisation, like `physics.h`/`physics_bullet.cpp`)

4. Engine
-------------------
* Current situation:
	* Implemented entity spawning and safety deleting, projectiles, player switching...

* Todo:
	* Reduce globals using (shared between modules globals)
	* Move out the console.c rendering code 

5. Collision system
-------------------
* Current situation:
	* Fixed back/front-facing polygons orientation for physics geometry, now the engine has a working _Filtered Ray Test_ (skips back-faced polygons)
	* Collision margin is zero, otherwise normals in near edges become smooth and Lara slides down or stops in places she should not
	* Refactored collision callbacks implementation that allow to register hit damage and any other collisions
  
* Todo:
	* Fix moving after landing on sloped surface:
		* Find body parts that stop Lara
		* Tune collision form, or disable collision checking for them
		* Bind with 3
	* Make rigid body parts shapes tunable by config (partially done)
	* For future optimization, add switchable single ghost object for character
	* Add _Long Ray Test_ (pierces rooms portals and builds room list for collisional checking) - needed for long range shooting and AI
	* Re-implement Character_FixPosByFloorInfoUnderLegs(...) it has been deleted
	* Check room tween butterfly normals

6. Character controller
-----------------------
* Todo:
	* Base AI (tune behavior, mud), path finding (fix boxes filtering logic), ...
	* Fix usage of weapons while crouching (no target targeting forward)
	* Add correct implementation for TR2+ weapons

7. Animation control
--------------------
* Todo:
	* Update documentation about `ss_animation` structure and functions
	* Fix incorrect smoothing if there are _move_ or _rotate_ anim commands
	* Fix dive-rolls:
		* Roll is not commencing immediately while moving forward
		* Rolls distance too great (e.g. falling off 1x1m ledges when on opposite edge)
	* Fix forward and backward consecutive jump rolls (mid-air rolls) not concatenating correctly on keypress (TR2+)
	* Fix swan dive not doable when jumping off of irregular (diamond shaped <>) slopes
	* Fix edge climbing:
		* Just fix configuration in state control

8. Camera control
-----------------
* Todo:
	* Add special `camera_entity`, store it in world module, access by `entity_p World_GetCameraEntity();` - needed for heavy triggers

9. Scripting
------------
* Current situation:
	* SEE TRIGGERS_tasks.md
	* Scripts update EVERY game frame! Use the global engine frame time inside time depended scripts!
* Todo:
	* Add function like `lua_SaveTable(...)` that recursively print to file/buffer/clay tablets lua code with table content (i.e. `table_name = { red = 1; green = 0; blue = 0; name = "name"; is_u = true; in_tbl = { p1 = "inner"; val = 32.45 } }`)
	* In all scripts that may change game state, data must be stored in special global table (that will be saved in save game) - needed for game save/load functions to correctly work

10. Audio
---------
* Current situation:
	* AL build-in library works on Windows, Linux and MacOS, but some people prefer to use only native AL library
* Todo:
	* Implement own audio routine thread (APIs like `Audio_Send(...)` allow that)
	* Use something else instead of Vorbis (it can't read _OGG_ from memory)
