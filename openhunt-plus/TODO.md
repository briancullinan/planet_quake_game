#### FEATURES

* More agressive/fast reaction monsters, especially guard type
* look if possible to make monster-bots and bots separate so real bots can be added
* investigate more about mapping for gamemode "Escape from Hell" (EFH).
* include g_unlagged.c (probably not needed)



#### Addons were made

* autoexec.cfg - more accurate gameplay
* zzz-hunt_sfx.pk3 - fix lens gfx in ffa gamemode (inside of default openhunt.pk3)
* zzz-hunt_redblood.pk3 - red blood instead of brown(inside of default openhunt.pk3)


#### Additional info
Thoose two files made by the original author from his website are missed.
If first file is probably not necessary because of new improved q3tools by Eugene C.,
then second would be very useful, though searching didn't give any results nor webarchive.

I've made a test EFH map without the mentioned file though, needs more investigation to make it work fine and write mini-instuction.
