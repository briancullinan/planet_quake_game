OpenHunt Plus - mod for Quake 3 Arena

==============================

Originally made by Jurgen "Juhox" Hoffmann.
This repo has working stable preinstalled OpenHunt 
based on Eugene C. improved baseq3a gamecode and fast q3tools.
Plus 3 cosmetic patches included, fov fix, lens flare in ffa bugfix and redblood instead of brown.

#### Instuctions:
Compile: run build\win32-qvm\build_all.bat
note: edit batchfile to your needs!

#### test environments path example
set testdir=C:\Users\rbrei\Desktop\q3openhunt

testdir is the path where you have your baseq3 installed, for testing the mod with fresh baked files

#### compression rate (1-10?)
you can set compression rate of the pk3 and zip archive as well
set cmprate=1

If you want just to play grab the hunt folder and put same location with your q3 exe and from mods play it. It's already with compiled openhunt vm.
