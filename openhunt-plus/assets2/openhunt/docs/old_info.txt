Requirements:
   Quake III Arena 1.32

Installation:
   1. Create a directory named "Hunt" in your Quake3 directory (which is
      the directory that contains the "baseq3" directory).

   2. Just copy the files mentioned above into the new directory. Take
      care to preserve the paths, e.g. "ctf_juhox_pliers.tss" should end
      up as "Quake3/Hunt/tss/ctf_juhox_pliers.tss."

   3. If there's a "hunt1.pk3" file in your Hunt installation directory,
      make sure to delete it.

   To run the Hunt mod start Quake3 and choose "Hunt" from the "Mods"
   menu. You can immediately play a match. Thereafter, don't forget to
   check at least the "manual.txt" to learn more about Hunt.

- hunt_oct_28_2002 / version Oct 28 2002 / 3.31MB

- efh02 / version Jul 30 2002 / 2.21MB 
Optional map for Hunt's gametype "Escape from Hell." 	

- hunt_music / version Jul 6 2001 / 13.6MB 
Optional music package. Contains a title song (1:31) and a victory song (1:15), both created by me. They're exclusively dedicated to Hunt. The file's a bit large because Q3A does not support MP3.

- hellmodels_nov_7_2002 / version Nov 7 2002 / 483KB 
Optional skin pack by Daniel "Fusion" Schneider <http://www.planetquake.com/td>. Contains a "hellish" skin for Klesk, Sorlag, and Uriel, for use as Predator, Guard, and Titan. If you install the pk3 file in your Hunt installation directory (instead of baseq3), then you'll also get new "hellish" gibs and blood effects for monsters!
