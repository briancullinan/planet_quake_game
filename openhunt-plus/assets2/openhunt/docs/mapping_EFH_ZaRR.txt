Some investigation about EFH mapping. 
Sadly we don't have JUHOX q3map, so probably current way to map for the gamemode is simply edit efh_test.map blocks into own. This is just standart efh1 map.



EFH NOTES:

skybox brushes:
_color 1 1 1
ambient 10
nearbox textures/efh01/nearbox

Skybox shouldn't be much big and not very small to make possible compile the map and not have farclip glitch while in-game.


some playersstarts has idnum, some not.


efh_hull seems like better to simply copy, since they are containing basic settings for EFH map to be generated while in-game. All of thoose entities are in same place.


efh_entrance:
mostly all 4 entities in same place with idnum 1-4, some of them are just single entity.

efh_exit:
mostly all 4 entities in same place with idnum 1-4  attached to latest brush which has
classname efh_null_brush
some of efh_exit are not all 4 in same place, just single ent.
Basicially latest brush with classname efh_null_brush is like outside of the map block.

floor brush always has idnum 0 though it's other brushes with classname efh_brush
idnum 0-4 (1-4) 

efh_monster:
classname efh_monster
count 10 (15,30)
idnum from 0 to 4 (1-4)
some of them has type 2 (guard)
and they are all 4 ents in same place

efh_model is probably changing vertex shader on some object, such as flag
classname efh_model
idnum 0
model models/flags/r_flag.md3


There is also efh_waypoint which I didn't even seen in the map.
