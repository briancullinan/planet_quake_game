Whee, time for beta-testing!  I'd like to thank everyone for their continued 
interest after all this time. :)  This is the short list of all the new 
stuff.  Check out the new, overhauled manual currently at 
http://ntplx.net/~argh/arghrad for more details on everything (see History 
index sections 3.00 & 2.50.  Note: example maps not yet available).  You can 
send me feedback at argh@ntplx.net.

Misc features:
 * Added texture format support for: TGA (32/24-bit), JPG, M32, M8, & PCX.
 * Support for .pak files with any name.
 * Better automatic detection of game, gamedir & moddir from bsp path.
 * Displays a table of texture reflectivity/emitted colors in -v mode.
 * Support for up to 9 suns.
 * Various bugfixes.

Worldspawn:
 _sky_ambient    - Synonym for _sun_ambient.
 _sky_surface    - Synonym for _sun_surface.
 _sun*_style $   - Set a lightstyle # for sun, or use the targetname of a
                   triggered light to make sun use the same trigger.
 _shadow # #     - Make visible world faces with NODRAW flag cast shadows.
                   First # for non-TRANS* faces, second # for TRANS* faces:
                      0  no shadows                              (default=1 3)
                      1  black shadows
                      2  single-color shadows (uses reflectivity)
                      3  projects the texture

Light Entities:
 _bounce #       - Set to 0 to make this light not bounce.
 _cap #          - Cap light brightness at #.
 _diffade #      - Used by _sun.
 _diffuse #      - Used by _sun.
 _distance #     - Set fade distance in units.  Result depends on _falloff:
                     0   = smoothly fades out over # units (overrides _fade)
                     1,2 = abruptly cuts off at # units
 _lighttag #     - Make this light control all LIGHT faces with a value of #.
                   Those faces will use this light's: _color, _distance, 
                   _focus, light, _lightmin, & style.
 _sun #          - Make this light define a sun.  The sun will use this
                   light's: _color, _diffade, _diffuse, light, & style.

BModels:
 _distance       - Works like light's _distance (with falloff 2).
 _lightorigin # # # - Shift bmodel to coordinate (#,#,#) for lighting.
 _lightswitch $  - Set to targetname of a triggered light to make this
                   bmodel's light use the same trigger.
 _shadow # #     - Make visible bmodel faces with NODRAW flag cast shadows.
                   First # for non-TRANS* faces, second # for TRANS* faces:
                     0  no shadows                               (default=0 0)
                     1  black shadows
                     2  single-color shadows (uses reflectivity)
                     3  projects the texture
                   Make either # negative (-1, -2, -3) to force all the 
                   bmodel's faces (not just NODRAW) to cast shadows.

Command-Line:
 -game $         - Set game: Q2 (default Quake2), H2 (Heretic2), KP (KingPin).
 -gamma #        - Apply gamma curve to final lighting.
 -lightwarp      - Create lightmaps for WARP surfaces.
 -minlighta #    - (changed) Cap minimum style-0 light brightness at #.
 -minlight #     - (changed) Same as -minlighta but uses id's 0-2 range.
 -nobouncefix    - Disable fix for bmodels getting too much bounced light.
 -nobrightsurf   - Don't make faces with LIGHT flag bright.
 -noinvisfix     - Disable fix for invisible bmodel faces bouncing light.
 -nonudgefix     - Disable new method of nudging edge lightsample coords.
 -noradorigin    - Disable fix for origin'd bmodels getting no bounced light.
 -noshadowface   - Disable all shadowfaces.
 -noshadowfilter - Disable bilinear filtering on shadowface projections.
 -noweightcurve  - Don't weight Phong curve calculations by face size.
 -saturation #   - Set saturation scale of colored light.
 -stylemin #     - Set minimum brightness cutoff for non-style-0 lights.
 -update         - Disable light calcs & just update existing lightmaps with:
                   -ambienta, -ambient, -gamma, -maxlighta, -maxlight, 
                   -minlighta, -minlight, -nocolor, -nocoloru, -saturation, &
                   -scale.
