At Santa Clara, I collaborated on some low temperature research that explored certain organic compounds for high temperature superconductivity.  I also published two papers on the thermodynamics of interconnected soap bubbles and interconnected rubber balloons.<P>In 1978, I was hired by the Electromagnetic Systems Laboratories, which had just been acquired as a subsidiary by TRW.  Its name was then changed to ESL, Inc.  By the way, ESL was founded by William Perry, then Secretary of Defense.  At ESL, I was involved in computer imaging and computer graphics work, especially for the defense sector of the government. But we also did commercial work for the oil and mineral exploration industry.  ESL was a pioneer in the computer imaging industry and sold perhaps the finest digital image processing system ever made.  I was a principle algorithm developer and application engineer for this system and also trained the customers on its use.<P>In 1979-1980, I was co-inventor of the <A HREF="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/fmw/ipt.html">Image Perspective Transformation Technology (IPT)</A>.  This was a photogrammetry-based computer graphics technology that permited overhead photographs of urban areas to be reconstructed at arbitrary vantage points, in particular, at ground level. (The equivalent of this technology now forms the basis of Google Earth.)<P>From 1986-1989, I was a systems engineer at ESL, responsible for data base development and processing methodology for several visual and infrared flight simulation data base projects and proposals. These activities were based upon the IPT technology.<P>During 1993 and 1994, I was a project manager and co-venture manager.  I launched one of 7 new ventures as part of ESL's commercial diversification program.  That new venture applied the IPT 3-D data base and visualization technology to characterize radioactively hazardous obsolete nuclear fuel processing facilities prior to their decontamination and decommissioning.<P>From 1995 to 1998, I consulted in graphics/digital image processing and started  a new business as a World Wide Web content developer. My partner and I founded a company, called WEBD.  One of our projects was to put all the maps and bus schedules on the World Wide Web for the Santa Clara County Transportation Agency.  Additional website projects included those for other transportation agencies and major medical societies.<P>From 1998 to 2005, I cofounded several startups doing virtual tours for the real-estate industry (realtyvision.com, mediavisionlive.com and seeitbuyit.com) and for various local businesses (yellowpageslive.com). I was the chief technical officers in those ventures.<P>In 2006, I retired, but volunteer to answer questions on the Imagemagick forum about digital image processing with Imagemagick (an open source image processing language). I have created over 300 Unix bash shell scripts utilizing Imagemagick to create interesting effects and enhance digital images. See <a href="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick" target="_blank">http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick</a>. I still consult from time-to-time on interesting projects involving digital image processing.<P>Here is my list of <a href="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/fmw/fmw_pubs.html" target="_blank">publications</a> in Digital Image Processing and Physics.<P>I can be contacted via email: fmw at alink dot net.<P><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.fmwconcepts.com/fmw/ltm.gif" HSPACE=5 ALIGN=absmiddle WIDTH=148 HEIGHT=84><FONT COLOR="#FF0000" SIZE=+2>So ...
